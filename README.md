## Build a Chatbot using if-else

## 1. Objective:

To create a simple rule-based chatbot that responds to user input using if-elif-else conditions.

## 2. Tools Used:

Python

## 3. Deliverable:

A Python script that simulates a basic chatbot.

## 4. Description:

The chatbot interacts with the user through text input.

It uses if-elif-else statements to match user input with specific responses.

The chatbot runs in a loop and ends when the user types “bye” or “exit.”

This helps understand the basic logic used in Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## 5. Working Steps:

Create a Python file named chatbot.py.

Use an input loop to take user messages.

Check the message using if-elif-else conditions.

Print matching replies for greetings, help, or questions.

Exit the loop when the user types “bye.”

## 6. Hints / Mini Guide:

Use input() for taking user input.

Use print() to display chatbot replies.

Convert input to lowercase using .lower() for easy comparison.

Use simple if-elif-else statements for different responses.

## 7. Outcome:

Learn how rule-based chatbots work.

Understand how to use conditions and loops in Python.

Gain basic knowledge of how chatbots handle text input.
